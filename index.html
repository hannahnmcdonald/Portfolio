                            Hi! I'm Hannah.
                        </p> 
                        <p>
                            I'm a Registered Nurse turned Web Developer. Most of my nursing career has been spent working in the Emergency Department. In my spare time I like running, hiking, photography, and traveling. I started out teaching myself programming as a hobby, and I loved it immediately. I loved the creativity that in involved and I was hooked very early. This discovery pushed me to enroll in a Bootcamp for a more structured education so I could pursue a career in it in the future. I am proud of myself for chasing this dream all while still working as a registered nurse. I have learned so much from my bootcamp instructors as well as from freecodecamp, Udemy, r/LearnProgramming, and Stack Overflow. I love learning and believe that learning is a lifelong journey to improve oneself. Check out my work below!
